![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cec90d7-92d0-4cfe-87ec-663438edcd18)

This repository contains custtom optimized print profiles & the last known version of the Bambu Lab A1 firmware that allows unrestricted access for third-party applications and speed up configuration for printing faster.

As of firmware versions after 01.04, Bambu Lab introduced restrictions that limit third-party software access unless connected via their Connect software. This version maintains full functionality for offline use and compatibility with third-party applications such as:

- OrcaSlicer
- Home Assistant integrations
- Custom print servers and scripts

## ðŸŽ¯ Print Profiles for PETG/COPET (LBL)

This repository includes two finely tuned print profiles(Orca slicer) for **PETG/COPET LBL** (https://lbl-corp.com/) filament, optimized for Bambu Lab A1:

### ðŸ”¹ `PETG_COPET_LBL_BASE` â€“ Balanced Performance & Quality

- **Speed**: +30% faster than stock PETG profiles without loss of quality
- **Quality**: Maintains excellent surface finish and dimensional accuracy
- **Use case**: Ideal for functional parts, visual models, and production-quality prints
- **Details**: nozzle 0.4, t/hotend - 245, t/bed - 70, layer width 0.4, layer height 0.2, maximum volume flow 12mm3/sec

### ðŸ”¹ `PETG_COPET_LBL_HYPER` â€“ High-Speed Prototyping

- **Speed**: +170% faster than stock 0.2 PETG profiles
- **Quality**: Acceptable for drafts, fittings, and rapid iteration
- **Use case**: Best suited for early-stage prototyping where speed is critical,
- **Details**: nozzle 0.4, t/hotend - 255, t/bed - 70, layer width 0.4-0.6, layer height 0.28, maximum volume flow 23mm3/sec

Both profiles are designed to leverage the A1's motion system while ensuring optimal extrusion, cooling, and layer adhesion specific to LBL-grade PETG/COPET filament.
To improve print quality, **please calibrate the K-factor after setup.**

## ðŸ”§ How to Install firmware

To install the firmware from this repository, follow these steps based on the official documentation:

1. **Download the Firmware folder**

   - Use the `firmware folder` folder provided in this repository and copy zip folder to the root directory of a microSD card (FAT32 format).

2. **Prepare the Printer**
